# Document-Retrieval-and-Recommender-System
A simple document recommender system using turi create library and knn classification model.
Suppose we are reading any wiki article, and wish to read related articles, how can we do that? This model, here can help with such situations by recommending the related articles, based on the topic discussed in the current article. A knn-classifier model has been used for this project.
Please follow my repository of Regression model creation-https://github.com/Aritrik-Guha/Turi-Create-Regression-Model to know how to use the Turi library on Windows, or Mac-Os.
